# Java
=================================
# Simple: Easy to learn (Open Source)
# Portable: Run on any operating system
# Object Oriented: Everything is dealt as Object
# Secure: Use "no pointers" and run inside VM sandbox
# Distributed: Use "Remote Method Invocation" RMI
# Robust: Garbage collection and Memory allocation
# Class based: It help create hierarchy, can define classes and inherit classes
# Concurrent: Parallely write and run codes
# Low dependencies

# Widely Used
=================================
# Develop Android applications
# Develop Hadoop applications
# Develop Web applications
# Develop applications servers
# Develop BCM tools

# Java Framework
=================================
# Hibernate: Let you connect to various objects/databases
# Spring: Use existing code to crate various customised applications
# Apache Hadoop
# Struts

# Why not C++
=================================
# C++ does not provide efficient means for garbage collection
# no build in support for thread
# Complex for graphic rich applications
# C++ is not platform independent
# Memory allocation needs to be done by the developer

# Java Compilation
=================================
# ***Java code (.java) -> JavaC compiler -> ByteCode (.Class) -> JVM***

# Java Memory
=================================
# Pointers: Points to a Memory that holds some data. Acts as reference
# Java has no pointers. JVM handles the Memory allocation and de-allocation
# Heap: Memory area in JVM where various objects created
# Heap is divided into two sections
 - Young Space (newly allocated Objects)
 - Old Space
# Garbage Collector: Memory freed during runtime by a special thread

#Array
=================================
# Array: Data Structure that holds sequential values
# Array always starts from 0 (always n-1)
# Array hold same type of data type values
# Multi-dimentional Array

#Function
=================================
# Function is piece of Code to be executed
# Function has group of Statement to be executed
# Function has a task to perform
