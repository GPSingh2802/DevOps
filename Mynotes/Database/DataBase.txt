#SQL vs NoSQL
==========================
# SQL - Structured Query Language
# SQL - Language to query data

# SQL
# Database Structure - Strict Schemas
- Tables
 - Columns (Field)
 - Rows (Records)
# All Records have to follow the Schemas
# Multiple Tables - Relations (1-1, 1-Many, Many- Many)
# Horizontal and Vertical Scaling difficult
# Limitation for lots (thousands) read and write per queries per second (SQL)


# MongoDB (NoSQL)
# Database has collections
# Collections have Documents
# Documents do not have to follow same Schemas!!
# Advantage: Flexible database
# No relations!!

# Horizontal Scaling: Add more Servers (DB to be split-up, not suited for SQL, go for NoSQL)
# Vertical Scaling: Add power to existing Server (Limit of Vertical Scaling)
# Great performance for mass read and write requests
