# Volume vs Vault Storage
=============================
- Volume: Storage device that is formatted to Store directories and files for frequent use
- Vault: Storage box or Container which stores the archive date for long period of time

# Traditional Storage Tier
=============================
- Tier0: SSD(Volume)
- Tier1: 10k rpm HDD(RAID, mirror, replication) (Volume)
- Tier2: 7.2k rpm HDD(RAID, Erasure Coding) (Vault)
- Tier3: Tape or Cold HDD (Vault)

** Tier3 to Tier0: Cost up, Performance up and lower Capacity
** All storage available in cloud with lesser Cost

# Advantage of Cloud Storage
==============================
- Pay as you use, no upfront payment
- Easy cloud based backup and archiving solutions
- Faster service with low cost and low risk (backup, data protection)
- Data reduction technique
- Easy Migration of data

# AWS Cloud Storage Services
==============================
 Service Model where data is
 - Maintained
 - Managed
 - Backed up remotely
 - Made available to users over network

 User pay
 - pay per use
 - Monthly rate

# Storage Option on AWS
===============================
- Block Storage (Elastic Block Storage (EBS)) [Tier0 and Tier1]
- Object Storage (Simple Storage Solution(S3), Glacier) [Tier2 and Tier3]
- Connecting Storage (Storage Gateway(on prem Software appliance with Cloud based Storage) and Snowball)

** Block storage can be accessed by only one machine/instance at a time, whereas Object Storage can be accessed directly by Multiple Machines

# Common Terms
===============================
- SSD: Solid State Drive
- IOPS: I/O Operations per Second
- TiB: Tebibyte 1TiB=1.10TB=1024 Gibibytes
- GiB: Gibibyte 1GiB:1.07GB=1024 Mebibyte
- MiB: Mebibyte 1MiB=1.05MB=1024 Kibibyte

# EBS Snapshot
===============================
- Backup data on EBS volumes to S3 by taking point-in-time Snapshot
- Snapshot are Incremental backups
- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted

# EBS Features
================================
** EBS volume can be attached to any running instance that is in same availability Zone
** Even after terminating EC2 instance, EBS volume is not deleted
** All the instance support EBS encryption
** For simplified data encryption, EBS Volume can be launched as encrypted volumes

** You cannot change the CMK (Customer Management Key) that is associated with an existing snapshot or encrypted volume
** However, you can associate a different CMK during a snapshot copy operation so that the resulting copied snapshot uses the new CMK
   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#EBSEncryption_key_mgmt]

** Amazon EBS encryption offers a simple encryption solution for your EBS volumes without the need to build, maintain, and secure your own key management infrastructure. When you create an encrypted EBS volume and attach it to a supported instance type, the following types of data are encrypted:
  - Data at rest inside the volume
  - All data moving between the volume and the instance
  - All snapshots created from the volume
  - All volumes created from those snapshots
   [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#EBSEncryption_key_mgmt]

** You cannot enable encryption for an existing EBS volume

# Type of EBS volume
================================
- Provisioned IOPS (20k IOPS, 320 MiB/sec)
- General Purpose (10K IOPS, 160 MiB/sec)
- Magnetic

# Simple Storage Service (S3)
=================================
 - Object is fundamental entities stored in ASW S3
 - Each S3 objects has data, a key and Metadata
 - Each S3 Object is identified within a bucket by a key(name) and a Version ID
 - Each Object can Contain up to 5 TB of data

 - Bucket used to store Objects, which consist of data and Metadata
 - buckets can be configured and created in any Specific Region
 - When an Object is added to the bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique Version ID and assign it to the object
 - By default 100 buckets can be created in on AWS.

 - AWS S3 Access Control line: Bucket permission Specifies who is allowed the access to the object in the bucket and what particular permission have been granted
 - Bucket Policies

 # Type of S3 storage
 ================================
 - Standard
 - Standard - Infrequent access
 - Glacier

 # AWS S3 - Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS)
 ================================
 - Stores non-critical, reproducible data at lower level Redundancy then S3 Standard storage

 ** Cross region replication: Bucket level Feature that enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across buckets in different AWS Region

# AWS S3 Versioning
==================================
- Versioning is means of keeping multiple variants of an Object in the same bucket
- Versioning enabled buckets enable you to recover objects from accidental deletion or Overwrite
- Once Versioning is enabled on bucket, it can not return back to un-versioned state but Versioning can be suspended

# AWS S3 transfer Acceleration
==================================

# AWS Glacier
==================================
- Extremely low cost Storage Services
- Data is stored in AWS Glacier in "Archives"
- A single archive can be as large as 40 Terabytes
- Unlimited numbers of archives and data

# Storage Gateway
==================================
- Connects on-premises Software appliance (AWS Storage Gateway appliance) with Cloud based Storage
- Type of Storage Gateway
 A. Volume based
  a. Cached volume: Low latency for frequently used data with all data stored in AWS
  b. Stored volume: Low latency for all the data with point-in-time backups to AWS
 B. Virtual tape library: Replacement for on-premises physical infrastructure for backup and archive

 # Snowball
 ==================================
 - Petabyte-Scale data transport Solution
 - Help in moving large amount of data in and out of AWS using portable storage devices for transport
