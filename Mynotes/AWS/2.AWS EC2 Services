# EC2 & EC2 Instances
====================================
- AWS Cloud Compute Services offering
- Elastic Cloud Compute
- Provides scalable Computing Capacity
- EC2 virtual Servers are called as Instances

# EC2 Instance Metadata
====================================
- Used for Configuring and Managing running Instance
- Is data about Instance
- Includes - Instance id, AMI id, hostname, IP address, role etc.

# Type of EC2 Instances
===================================
- General Purpose : Running Small and Md-size databases, data processing tasks that require additional memory for running backend Servers
- Compute Optimised : Used for distributed Cache, in-memory analytics, large deployment of SAP, SharePoint and other enterprise Applications
- Storage Optimised : Large scale DataWare House
- memory Optimised : In-memory database, processing engine like Spark
- GPU Instances : 3D Application streaming, machine learning, Video encoding

# EC2 Purchase Options
===================================
- On-demand (For Specific period of time)
- Reserved (For long period of time)
- Spot (Need instance only once, hourly rates, no upfront commitment, cost lower than on-demand)

# AMI Amazon Machine Image
====================================
 - It is image of a server including an OS and often additional Software
 - PreConfigured templates for the creation of Virtual Server (EC2 Instances)
 - Users can select an AMI provided by AWS, user community, or through the AWS MarketPlace

 ** When you launch the AMI, an EBS volume is created from each snapshot. Because EBS already supports encryption of data volumes, you can now create a single AMI with a fully-encrypted set of volumes
    [https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-encrypted-ebs-boot-volumes/]

 ** AMIs that are backed by Amazon EBS snapshots can take advantage of Amazon EBS encryption. Snapshots of both data and root volumes can be encrypted and attached to an AMI

# Security Groups
====================================
- Act as an Virtual Firewall

- Public Key + Private Key = Key pair
- AWS EC2 uses Public and Private key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information

# Tenancy - Shared and Dedicated
====================================

# Elastic IP and Elastic Network Interface
=====================================
- Network Interface is the point of interconnection between a Machine and a Private or Public Network
- An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is a virtual network Interface that you can attach to multiple instances in a VPC
